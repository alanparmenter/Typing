# Typing
 
I have been practising typing the 'ten key' numbers with these ruby scripts
The rationale is that the simplest drills offer the greatest concentration

Recommended order:
typing56.rb – practice the numbers for which an extension is needed
typing567.rb – add the home position for the right hand
typing456.rb – same with home position for the left hand
typing4567 – both hands for home and extended index finger
typing7890 – the complete home position for the right hand
typing1234 – the complete home position for the left hand
