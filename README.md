# Typing
 
I have been practising typing the 'ten key' numbers with these ruby scripts.
My rationale here is that the simplest drills offer the greatest concentration.

Call a script from the command line, to get ten tests, with ten randomised numbers.
Each test scores a point out of ten, and there is a timing in seconds at the end.

Recommended order to practice the number combinations:
typing56.rb – extended positions for both index fingers,
typing67.rb – right index finger home and extended,
typing45.rb – left index finger home and extended,
typing7890.rb – right hand home position,
typing1234.rb – left hand home position,
typing4567.rb – left and right index fingers, home and extended,
typing67890.rb – right hand home position and extended index finger,
typing12345.rb – left hand home position and extended index finger,
typing#.rb – single digit numbers for all ten keys,
typing##.rb – double digit numbers for all ten keys,
typing###.rb – triple digit numbers for all ten keys.
